These pickles contain vertices and triangles of
the surface triangular mesh of asteroids.

Usage: 

with open("3dmeshes/Eros.pk", "rb") as f:
    points, triangles = pk.load(f)

The files *_raw are direct exports from the original 3d model. They thus contain the mesh in some axis and in units.
The files *_lp contain downsized models with 1/10 of the triangles.
