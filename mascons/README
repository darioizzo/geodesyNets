This directory contains mascons models for famous asteroids.
NOTE: coordinates are scaled differently (1/10, 1/100) for different models
NOTE: values of the masses are the volume of the surrounding finite element, so also to be taken as relative

Usage:

with open("Itokawa_mascon.pk", "rb") as file:
    mascon_points, mascon_masses = pk.load(file)
