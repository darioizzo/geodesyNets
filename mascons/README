This directory contains mascons models for famous asteroids.
NOTE: scales are different for different models
NOTE: values of the masses are derived from the volume of the corresponding thetraedron for models deriving from 3dmeshes
ans mostly the same for models deriving from point clouds simulations from MPIA hd5 files.

Usage:

with open("Itokawa_mascon.pk", "rb") as file:
    mascon_points, mascon_masses = pk.load(file)
