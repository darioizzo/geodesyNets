These pickles contain vertices and triangles of
the surface triangular mesh of asteroids.

Usage: 

with open("3dmeshes/Eros.pk", "rb") as f:
    points, triangles = pk.load(f)

The files *_raw are direct exports from the original 3d model. They thus contain the mesh in some axis and in units
(except for Hollow that is mascon generated and thus the meshes are derived from there directly. The raw files are thus
only here for consistency as they are identical to the non raw ones)
The files *_lp contain downsized models with 1/10 of the triangles.
